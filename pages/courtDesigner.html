    <h3>Court Options</h3>

    <div class="LRSec">
      <input
        type="color"
        name="Background Color"
        id="backgroundInput"
        placeholder="#000000"
      />
      <div>
        <h4>Background Color</h4>
        <p>
          This color will be used as the surrounding color outside of the actual
          court, making it the likely first part of any design a spectator will
          notice. Feel free to make it vibrant or muted, any color will work
          beautifully.

    <div class="LRSec">
      <input
        type="color"
        name="Line Color"
        id="lineInput"
        placeholder="#000000"
      />
      <div>
        <h4>Line Color</h4>
        <p>
          This color will be used as the color throughout the court. As courts
          are typically lighter wood colors, we recommend a darker or
          contrasting color to the base court color.

    <div class="LRSec">
      <input
        type="color"
        name="Court Color"
        id="courtInput"
        placeholder="#D7AC70"
      />
      <div>
        <h4>Court Color</h4>
        <p>
          This color will be used as the base color of the actual court, making
          it a key aspect of the design. Will your court respect tradition or
          blaze a new trail?

    <div class="LRSec">
      <input type="file" name="Court Logo" id="logoInput" />
      <div>
        <h4>Center Logo</h4>
        <p>
          This logo will stamp the brand of the team on top of the court,
          marking this as the home of your team. Here is where magic is made.
          Memories of this hallowed ground will last for centuries. This is our
          home.

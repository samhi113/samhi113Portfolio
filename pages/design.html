          <p>Our department merged with another department on campus and therefore changed names to convey our combined mission. Once the name was finalized and began seeing public usage, I was asked to design a new logo in a similar vein to our old logo. For this project, I utilized Adobe Illustrator for its easy ability to create various vector graphics. I recreated our old logo and then began changing these elements to encompass our new name and University Brand Guidelines. After proposing several iterations to department heads, one was chosen as a lead candidate, then alterations were made to improve legibility, and then contrasting versions for usage against a dark background.</p>

          <p>Our department moved into a new space referred to as Jaguar Junction. This space was designated as a space for departments that previously had locations spread around campus to have one centralized space to simplify students’ experience. As we moved in, I designed a logo for this space using Adobe Illustrator. I then drafted several use cases in Illustrator and Photoshop and proposed these items to University Communications for approval and further usage. They requested minor changes which took a few minutes, and used the logo in various mediums and forms.</p>

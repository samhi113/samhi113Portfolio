            <p>This site lets users create backgrounds of NBA jerseys with custom names and numbers. Each jersey was sourced from the <a href="https://basketballjerseyarchive.com/nba-jerseys/" target="_blank">Basketball Jersey Archive</a> and it wholly wouldn't exist without it.</p>
            <p>This site was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a large usage of designing via Adobe Illustrator. Javascript is used for most data handling and basic functionality. One major part of the site is the jerseys, which needed SVG usage to make sure the jersey's name appears similar to the real-life jerseys.</p>

          <div class="vertSec">
            <p>Travel-fly is a template website created for a travel agency. This site hosts information about the company, packages, deals, locations, and contact methods to plan a vacation. This site uses HTML to house the physical content, Sass to style and organize the content. One major hurdle I encountered during this was how to host the images for the home page. While all other pages allowed for images without issue, no matter what I tried, the hero content refused to show the background image I desired, which eventually was solved by reworking the hero entirely.</p>

            <p>This site is a template website created for an event planning company. This site hosts information about the company, a photo gallery of satisfied clients, a blog space for up-and-coming trends in the event hosting space, and lastly a contact method, including a contact form for the client to inquire about possible services. This site uses HTML to house the physical content, Sass to style and organize the content, and lastly, jQuery to allow for site navigation on one HTML file to house the navigation and footers, with varying files being used to hold the content on different pages, being loaded separately, which allows for much quicker response times.</p>

            <p>This site is a template e-commerce website for a book store. This was created in conjunction with a colleague, Arissa Green. I was tasked with general sites, styling, and basic content injection. Arissa handled most of the backend server tasks, the blog page, and everything related to the cart.</p>
            <p>This site was made using HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery. Sass was utilized for styling as it works well with nested elements. The button functions are handled in JavaScript and jQuery, as they enable for easy item selection.</p>
